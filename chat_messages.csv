Here are some bus routes that can help you navigate the city:

- Route 25: Camp - Shivajinagar
- Route 31: Swargate - Katraj

You can find bus stops throughout the city, and the routes cover most major attractions. For more information, you can visit the MSRTC website or ask the bus conductor for assistance.

Additionally, auto-rickshaws and taxis are also available for travel within the city. However, they may be more expensive compared to the local buses."
